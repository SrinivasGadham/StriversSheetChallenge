# StriversSheetChallenge
I am glad to announce that I am going to take up the #StriversSheetChallenge for this summer and I aim to complete the SDE sheet that help me get prepared for the upcoming placements and improve my problem solving abilities. Thank you Raj Vikramaditya for such continuous efforts to make us learn and be good at problem solving.
